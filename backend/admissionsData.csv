Then, I got a question like “What is critical thinking and why is it important to you?” where I just yapped (“as engineers/problem solving/considerate of others’ opinions”). Then for my third video, I mentioned that I wanted to MC for a cultural event at the local volunteer/non-profit organization (the question was something along the lines of if I felt like I had let someone down, what did I do about it and how did it turn out) that I’m a volunteer at, but I couldn’t MC because I had to get vaccinated that day. I felt like I had let them down because I informed them the night before, even if they were okay with it.

Video: Tell me about a time when you let yourself down. I told a story about poor time management, procrastination, and not taking something important seriously enough. I also included what I learned from that situation.","Honestly, for the KIRA talent questions, what they are looking for is key qualities from what you write or say that will make you a fit for your program. Definitely use ECs or experiences as ways of proving these qualities and make sure to reflect on what you experienced to show your personal growth—I think interviewers in general place a fair emphasis on that.

McMaster,Honours Health Sciences I,Rejected,94.5,McMaster portal/Mosaic,I didn't mention any ECs. ,"I think the second part (ie. the one you have to show how you approach current scenarios) of my supp app, was kinda weak looking back. It was more objective and honestly, I didn't make really strong points. Either way, I am happy with what I wrote for my supp app in the first section. My tip to those applying next year is to get someone to read over your supp app and be brutally honest whether it's convincing/moving or not. Good luck!!"
